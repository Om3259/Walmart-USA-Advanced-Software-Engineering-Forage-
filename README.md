# Walmart-USA-Advanced-Software-Engineering-Virtual-Experience
Overview
Successfully completed the Walmart USA Advanced Software Engineering Virtual Experience program, tackling complex technical challenges across multiple engineering domains. This comprehensive experience provided hands-on exposure to real-world software engineering practices at one of the world's largest retailers.
Skills Demonstrated

Advanced Data Structures: Designed and implemented custom heap data structures in Java
Software Architecture: Created UML class diagrams for complex data processing systems
Relational Database Design: Developed Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD) for enterprise-scale database systems
Data Munging: Wrote Python scripts to transform and load data across different formats and systems

Project Highlights
1. Advanced Data Structures Implementation
Developed a customized heap data structure in Java to support Walmart's shipping department operations:

Implemented a flexible, generic max-heap with configurable child count
Created efficient insertion and extraction algorithms with proper heap property maintenance
Designed comprehensive validation mechanisms to ensure data integrity
Optimized heapify operations for large-scale data processing

Technologies used: Java, Object-Oriented Programming
2. Software Architecture Design
Designed a modular data processing pipeline architecture to manage complex data flows:

Created UML class diagrams illustrating processor components and their relationships
Implemented multiple processing modes (Dump, Passthrough, Validate) with dynamic configuration
Designed database abstraction layer supporting multiple backend systems (Postgres, Redis, Elastic)
Applied software design principles to ensure extensibility and maintainability

Technologies used: UML, Software Design Patterns, Domain-Driven Design
3. Relational Database Design
Engineered a normalized database schema for Walmart's pet product management system:

Developed comprehensive Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD)
Created specialized entity models for different product types (pet food, toys, apparel)
Established proper relationships between products, manufacturers, animals, and customers
Designed transaction and shipment tracking systems with appropriate constraints

Technologies used: ERD, Relational Database Design, Normalization Principles
4. Data Munging & ETL Processing
Built an end-to-end data pipeline to process shipping data from multiple sources:

Developed Python scripts to extract data from various CSV spreadsheets
Transformed and consolidated shipping information across different data formats
Loaded processed data into SQLite database with appropriate relationships
Implemented data validation and error handling throughout the pipeline
